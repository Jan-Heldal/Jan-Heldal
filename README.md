- Hi, I’m @Jan-Heldal, a norwegian senior software engineer.
- This repo is not in use at the moment.
- I’m looking to collaborate on algorithm designs, especially if related to signal processing, automated classification, embedded  artificial intelligence or other semi-intelligent systems.
- The best way to reach me is currently by LinkedIn.
