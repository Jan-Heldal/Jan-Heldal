- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jan-Heldal, a norwegian senior software engineer with two university degrees: Master of Technology (MTech) and Bachelor in Computer Science (CompSci).
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithm design, visualization of numerical abstract spaces, and in theoretical exploration along the limits of what should be logically possible or not. My fields of interest are mainly (in no particular order) sensor processing, machine learning, physics, number-theory, information-theory, biology and brains. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, NumPy and OpenCv.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on noisy-bluetooth positioning, noisy-dead-reckoning and automated product-verification using machine-vision.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on algorithm designs, especially if related to: adaptive artificial intelligences, other semi-inelligent systems, or visualization of complicated systems or datasets.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by SMS at (plusfourseven) fourfive sixsix twozero threeone.
